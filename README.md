# Fermi_Stacking_Analysis

This repository contains code for running a gamma-ray stacking analysis with Fermi-LAT data. The technique was originally developed by Marco Ajello, Vaidehi Paliya, and Abhishek Desai, and it has been successfully applied to the following studies: <br />
* Extreme blazars [(link)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02496.pdf)  <br />
* Star-forming galaxies [(link)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05493.pdf) <br />
* Extragalactic background light [(link)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01031.pdf) <br />
* Ultra-fast outflows [(link)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac1bb2) <br />

The stacking analysis requires Fermipy, available [here](https://fermipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). <br />
